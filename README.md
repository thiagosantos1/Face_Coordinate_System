# Face Coordinate System

In this project,I will investigate and build a face coordinate system, which has many applications, including face recognition.

# Steps
  1) Built several manual convolutions to create a simple coordinate system of features in face images.
  
  2) Use the idea of pixel intensity to determine the "most" important pixels which may represent an important feature.

# Output
