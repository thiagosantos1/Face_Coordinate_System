# Face Coordinate System

In this project,I will investigate and build a face coordinate system, which has many applications, including face recognition.

# Steps
  1) Built several manual convolutions to create a simple coordinate system of features in face images.
  
  2) Use the idea of pixel intensity to determine the "most" important pixels which may represent an important feature.

# Experiments
Results of our convolutions and pixel intensity detection

     <tr align='center' > 
        <td>Image after pixel intensity detection</td>         
        <td>Center of image --> Where the eyes certainly are </td>
         <td>Original image with rectangles in all features found it </td>
      </tr>
     <tr align='center' > 
        <td><img src="https://github.com/thiagosantos1/Face_Coordinate_System/blob/master/img.png" width="400" </td>
